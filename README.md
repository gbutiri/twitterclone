twitterclone
============

For those that claim they can build twitter in one day, you're right!

This project took me less than a day. Here's the feature list:

Completed: 

* Ajaxed the whole thing.
* Smart time detection for reading (based on browser GMT offset).
* Cross browser autosizing textarea.
* Load more button if more texts.
* Users and logins with salt, tokens, etc.


To Come:

* Signup Email Verification coming soon.
* Notification system for showing warning and errors upon signup/login.
* Database install similar to wordpress.
